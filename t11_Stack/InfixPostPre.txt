/* Infix , Postfix and Prefix
  

  Infix : that we generally write , use them in mathematical expressions and programset.
  eg: x+y*x

  postfix : xy+

  prefix : +xy

  advantages of prefix and postfix:
    -> do not require parenthesis , precedence rule or associativity

    -> can be evaluated by writing a program that traverses the given expression once.
