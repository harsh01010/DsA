# tracking and initializing a directory(or folder)

> suppose you have a folder or directory on your computer , in this directory you save all your codes and projects
  and you want  to track all the changes in your codes (e.g: log of changes in code , recovering deleted files e.t.c.)
  then you can initialize your git in this directory.
  so,
> Open your desired directory , right click and you would be able to see these two options 1. git gui here 2. git bash here
> click on git bash here.
  you will see a command line interface.

> To initialize git in this directory use following command:  |
                                                              |   
    git init                                                  |
                                                              |
> Set user and email for first time -                         |  
  use following command                                       |
   f or name:                                                 |        YOU DON'T HAVE TO REPEAT THESE STEPS AGAIN , THEY ARE FOR INITIAL SETUP
             git config --global user.name "yourname"         | 
  for email:                                                  |
             git config --global user.email "youremail"       | 
                                                              |
 after this you can check using following command:            |
             git config --list                                |

# creating GITHUB repository and attaching it's url to our project / directory

. go to https://github.com/ , create an account(sign  up) if you don't have a git github account

> creating repository:
. go to create new repository on GitHub webpage or https://github.com/new & create a new repository , give it  any name , choose it's visibility(public or  private)
and click on create repository.
.Now you will land onto the repository page , which you have just created,
you can see a link on the top part in code section (e.g. https://github.com/harsh01010/fictional-potato.git) , you need to copy this link which will be used to attach your git with github.

> attaching to directory:

To upload your codes  or projects on github you need to push it using git command , and before it you have to attach the link of your repository, where you want to
upload.
to attach use the following command:
   
        git remote add origin  url      (url is the link of your repository ,  which you have just copied)

that's it your repository and directory has been linked :)

to check the linked repository to your directory use the command:

        git remote -v

Now suppose you have written some code or edited a previous file in this your directory And your want to save all the changes on GitHub,

then use add , and commit (i have discussed these command above) and check the status.

after that push the changes on github using following command:(make sure you are connected to internet)
 
    git push origin master
