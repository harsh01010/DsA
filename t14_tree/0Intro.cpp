node: all the items that we see in a tree is called node.

root: at top of the hierarcy we have root node.

leaf:nodes which are bottom of the hierarcy , which do not have any thing below then is called leaf node.it has degree zero.

child: nodes which are just below of a node , is called children of that node.

parent: node which is above of a node is called parent of that node.
 
subtree: a tree itself contains many trees knows as subtree

descendants: all the nodes that lie in the subtree , assuming current node as root.

degree: degree of  a node is  number of children it has.

internal: all the nodes which are not leaf nodes.
