 // Deque -> doubly ended queue
 // we have two ends => fornt and rear , we can perform deletion and insertion from both the ends


 /*
    Funtions:

    insertfront() , deletefront();
    inertrear() , deleterear();
    getfront();
    getrear();
    isfull();
    isempty();
    size();



   Implementation -> linked list , array : using doubly linked list , circular array with front and rear indexes

   Applications:
       Deque can be used as both stack and queue.
       maintaing history of actions.
       a steal process sheduling algorithm.
       implementing a priority queue with two types of priorities.
       maximum/minimum of all subarrays of size k in a array.
